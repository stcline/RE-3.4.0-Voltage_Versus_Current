# :robot: 3.4.0 - Voltage Versus Current

The voltage and current are the two major aspects of electricity.The voltage is the type of the electromagnetic force whose effect causes the flow of electrical current in the circuit. The magnitude of a voltage and current depends on each other, but these two terms are different from each other in some ways.

One of the major differences between voltage and current is that the voltage is the difference between the two points and the current is the flow of electrical charges between these two points of an electric field. Some others differences between them are explained below in the comparison chart.

Here are two excellent Sparkfun videos to help us understand these concepts better:

## ü§ì Overview and learning outcomes 

The goal of this lab assignment is to demonstrate how the concepts of voltage and current differ.   The [Circuit Simulator App](https://thumbsdb.herokuapp.com/circuit/) will be used to help understand these concepts. üöÄ

## Use the Circuit Simulator to Construct two Sample Circuits

Build two identical circuits on Circuit Simulator App which contain the following:

- Voltage Source (1 terminal)
- 100 Ohm resistor
- LED of your choosing (same color for each circuit)
- Ground

## üíª Terms to know

- Voltage
- Current
- Volts
- Amperes (Amps)
- Voltage Drop
- Polarity

## üìù Next steps

Modify the circuits so that the voltage level of each circuit is different.  While both circuits are running you may visually observe the difference in current flow.  Hovering your mouse over any part of the circuit will also give you a value for current (represented by I).  Break either circuit and observe which of the two concepts (voltage or current) changes.

Create a file in this repository named "observations.md".  Describe what you built in the app and your observations about how voltage and current are different and how they interact with each other.
